# Smart Powered Trash Bin 🤖♻️

The Smart trash bin, works by firstly detecting if a hand is at the front of the sensor, then the laptop's built in camera detects from what material is the rubbish made out of, then the Kypruino board commands the servo motor thats glued to the lid of the trash can, to open it automatically and at the same time command the 0.91' OLED screen connected directly to the Kypruino board with the built in pins, to show from which material the rubbish is made out of, then the rubbish falls in the plate and it rotates to the right trash can (there are 4 subdivided trash cans inside of the actual trash can) and then the plate moves downward, drops the rubbish and returns in its original position. There is also an app made to tell exactly how much % are the 4 trash cans filled and if they're filled, the app sends a notification to empty the bins.

This project combines embedded systems, sensor integration, and mechanical control to create a functional smart waste solution focused on real-world environmental impact.
